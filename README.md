# NDOT Concrete Mix Design Automation

## Project Overview
This project involves converting NDOT’s existing Excel-based concrete mix design model into an automated Python code. The goal is to replicate all the given calculations from the “Mix Design” worksheet a create a program that asks you step by step for your information then provides back a weight chart for one cubic yard of concrete. The project will improve reliability and repeatability, while being intuitive to the user to reduce chance of error.

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file).
2. Run all cells in order.
3. Enter the required mix design inputs when prompted.
4. The program will generate a formatted weight chart.

## Notes
Four concrete mix scenarios were researched and evaluated using the automated model to verify accuracy.
